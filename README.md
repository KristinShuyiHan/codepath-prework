## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
When trying to connect storyboard elements to viewcontroller, I could not find the
"Add Editor" button. Then, I successfully located it by watching the gif tutorial. 
Also, instead of dragging the Label next to the 'Total' label, I accidentally drag the "Total" label and rename it. Then, I found out the mistake after testing it out on your desired iPhone simulator. Since I have learned how to use Github at my university, I did not encounter any challenge when using that. Overall, the whole process of learning to use Xcode was excited and fun to me. It was a little bit challenging becasue everything is new for me, but shortly after I get familarize with the interface and different tabs, I find it not hard to mainpulate. I belive I will be using this tool a lot, since my college major is design and interction, and my goal is building IOS apps.
