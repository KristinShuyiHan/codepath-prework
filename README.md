## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
When trying to connect storyboard elements to viewcontroller, I could not find the
"Add Editor" button. Then, I successfully located it by watching the gif tutorial. 
Also, instead of dragging the Label next to the 'Total' label, I accidentally drag the "Total" label and rename it. Then, I found out the mistake after testing it out on your desired iPhone simulator. Since I have learned how to use Github at my university, I did not encounter any challenge when using that. Overall, the whole process of learning to use Xcode was excited and fun to me. It was a little bit challenging becasue everything is new for me, but shortly after I get familarize with the interface and different tabs, I find it not hard to mainpulate. I belive I will be using this tool a lot, since my college major is design and interction, and my goal is building IOS apps.
